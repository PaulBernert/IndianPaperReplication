# IndianPaperReplication

My objective is to replicate the first four tables of this paper. I've been able to successfully replicate the first table, but have been unable to successfully replicate any of the ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions.

The paper has been highlighted and commented to get an idea of what I've noticed this far and what needs to still be done.
